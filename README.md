# DayTrader
This is a realtime software/framework, written in Java, that provides the typical functions of a "black box" trading system: Market Data Acquisition, 
Strategy Design (Alpha Generator), Account/Risk Management, Broker Interface Implementation (multi-threaded),and Reports of trading at the end of the day.
The engine is failry lightweight approxximatly 3500 lines of code, and has an easy to understand architecture. Please see the odf file in this repo to have
a sense of the class and sequence diagram. I am in the process of recordng two videos: 1) an user guide for running the engine; 2) a developer guide to extend
it. I will post thme when I am done.
