# DayTrader
This is a realtime software/framework, written in Java, that provides the typical functions of a "black box" trading system: Market Data Acquisition, 
Strategy Design (Alpha Generator), Account/Risk Management, Broker Interface Implementation (multi-threaded),and Reports of trading at the end of the day.
The engine is fairly lightweight and is approximatly 3500 lines of code. Furthemore it  has an architecture that should be simple to understand. 
Please see the pdf files in this repo to have
a sense of the class and sequence diagrams. I am in the process of recording two videos: 1) an user guide for running the engine; 2) a developer guide to extend
it. I will post them when I am done.
